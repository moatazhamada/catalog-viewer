# Git Flow Strategy

This project follows **Git Flow** branching strategy for better code organization and release management.

## Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Only merged from `release/` or `hotfix/` branches.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features. All feature branches merge here.
- **`feature/*`**: New features and enhancements (e.g., `feature/add-search`, `feature/tablet-support`)
- **`release/*`**: Preparation for releases (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical bug fixes for production (e.g., `hotfix/memory-leak`)

## Workflow

### Starting a New Feature
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR to develop
```

### Starting a Release
```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
# ... finalize release ...
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git tag v1.0.0
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.0.0
```

### Hotfix
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
# ... fix bug ...
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git tag v1.0.1
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
```

## Commit Message Convention

Following conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Current Status

This project was initially developed on `main` branch for simplicity. Going forward, we'll use proper Git Flow:
- New features → `feature/*` branches → `develop` → `release/*` → `main`
- Bug fixes → `hotfix/*` branches → `main` and `develop`
